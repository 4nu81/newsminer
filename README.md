you need to install Beautiful Soup https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/


If you’re using a recent version of Debian or Ubuntu Linux, you can install Beautiful Soup with the system package manager:

$ apt-get install python-bs4

Beautiful Soup 4 is published through PyPi, so if you can’t install it with the system packager, you can install it with easy_install or pip. The package name is beautifulsoup4, and the same package works on Python 2 and Python 3.

$ easy_install beautifulsoup4

$ pip install beautifulsoup4
